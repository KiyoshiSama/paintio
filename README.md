# paintio
Started this project 10th or 11th of july
Struggled and worked a lot with git and committed a few changes.
git repository became a mess so I put it away for about two weeks and saved my time for project
Struggled with painting the area inside the path for about 16 days
after finishing that, came back to git to make it right and clean
to make everything in order in git, I had to change the repository so I understand better what am I exactly doing in git.
uploaded a proof of strugglins with git which I mentioned earlier.
