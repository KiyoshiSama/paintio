# paintio
Started this project 10th or 11th of july
Struggled and worked a lot with git and committed a few changes.
git repository became a mess so I put it away for about two weeks and saved my time for project
Struggled with painting the area inside the path for about 16 days
after finishing that, came back to git to make it right and clean
to make everything in order in git, I had to change the repository so I understand better what am I exactly doing in git.
uploaded a proof of strugglins with git which I mentioned earlier.(just for making clear the first commit in this repository isn't actually the start date)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
my scale for the project is *3.
we don't have 180 degree rotation mechanism here (cause it just doesn't make sense xD)
bullet size is one block, so it is hard to hit enemies, but its mechanism works correctly(It's challenging to shoot the enemies). If you want to see the mechanism yourself , change bullet size and check.
the pictures in the game might not be loaded as you run the game in your system , to make them show correctly, change the pictures path according to your system's setting .(Pics are used in [GamePanel, Enemy, WeaponB, Clickhandler]classes.)
I also provided the windows executable file named PaintIO.
keyHints: when using keyboard , the player can move with arrows.the paining 3*3 gun works with enter button and the infinite traveler bullet works with space. When using mouse, as you left click the arrow pics on the screen , player's direction changes. when you right click, 3*3 painting gun triggers, when you hit left click , infitie bullet traveler triggers.
